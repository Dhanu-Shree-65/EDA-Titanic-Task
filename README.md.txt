 EDA - Titanic Dataset

Objective
To explore and understand the Titanic dataset using visualizations and summary statistics.

Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Steps
- Checked for missing data
- Summary statistics for all features
- Visualized distributions with histograms and boxplots
- Created correlation matrix
- Used countplots to observe relationships (e.g., gender vs survival)

 Key Insights
- Higher survival rate for females
- Younger passengers had better chances
- Fare and Pclass affect survival probability
- Several missing values in `Age` and `Cabin`

 Learnings
- How to visualize data patterns
- How to detect skewness and outliers
- Importance of cleaning and understanding data before modeling
